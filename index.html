    <!-- Below is an anchor without href that directs it to a webpage -->
    <!-- <a>About The Odin Project</a> -->
    <!-- By default, any text wrapped with an anchor tag without an href attribute will look like plain text. If the href attribute is present, the browser will give the text a blue color and underline it to signify it is a link.
    It’s worth noting you can use anchor tags to link to any kind of resource on the internet, not just other HTML documents. 
    You can link to videos, pdf files, images, and so on, but for the most part, you will be linking to other HTML documents. -->

    <a href="https://github.com/dashboard"><p>Link to my profile</p></a>

    <!-- While href specifies the destination link, target specifies where the linked resource will be opened. If it is not present, then, by default, it will take on the _self value which opens the link in the current tab. 
    To open the link in a new tab or window (depends on browser settings) you can set it to _blank as follows: -->

    <!-- The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened.
    The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. 
    The noreferrer value also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well. -->

    <!-- Below is a relatibe link. i.e, it is a page in my own website, not outside the page... Unlike the above ones, which are absolute links that redirect to another website. -->
